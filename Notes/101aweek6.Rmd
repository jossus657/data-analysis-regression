```{r}
mag <- read_csv("magazines.csv")
model1 <- lm(AdRevenue ~ AdPages, data = mag)
plot(model1) 
#how do we know the y value?
# y is usually what we want to predict while our x value is what we know or have control over, which makes sense in this scenario
```


transformations
- we have 9 potential models. we can take log or sqrt of either x or y
- best way to do this is to change your data frame to add these new transformations

```{r}

plot(AdRevenue ~ AdPages, data = mag)
abline(model1)
```
